# QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge I completed from Frontend Mentor.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I found it hard to center the card initally but remembered the use of display:flex and center alignment.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
